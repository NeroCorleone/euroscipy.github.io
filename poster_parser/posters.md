## Validation of Association - implementation in Python library

*Mateusz*, *Data Science and Visualisation*

**Abstract:** During out talk, we would like to present a Python library, that implements ideas proposed in the paper "Validation of Association" by Ä†miel Bogdan and Ledwina Teresa. The authors introduce a novel function-valued measure of dependence known as the quantile dependence function. This measure plays a pivotal role in constructing tests for independence and allows for easily interpretable diagnostic plots that highlight deviations from the null model. The quantile dependence function is specifically designed to identify general dependence structures between variables within different quantiles of their joint distribution. The authors develop new estimators for the dependence function and utilize them to devise innovative tests for independence.

## Visualizing and debugging tensors with aesthetic-tensor

*Iliya Zhechev*, *Community, Education, and Outreach*

**Abstract:** Researchers and ML Engineers working hands-on with tensors frequently have to inspect and visualize the contents of tensors in order to understand what they hold. Aesthetic-tensor is a Python library that works for PyTorch and NumPy that abstracts away tensor visualizations in an intuitive and easy-to-learn API. In this tutorial, we're going to explain the core concept of the API and walk through a few practical examples of how to use the library.

## Using time series to detect anomalies in a wide area network environment. Is it possible to solve such a problem using Python?

*PaweÅ‚ Å»al*, *Scientific Applications*

**Abstract:** Time series issues may seem destined only for a narrow group of data scientists, but in fact they can make the work of administrators, support people, researchers or developers themselves easier.

In the era of ubiquitous IoT, and the consequent intensive use of telemetry, time series make it possible to analyze the timing of events, correlate the dynamics of their occurrence, and ultimately facilitate the understanding of these phenomena.

Using Python, time series can be successfully analyzed, and when the amount of data exceeds the amount of available RAM, Python can use time series databases.

My experience allows me to present cases from the practical use of time series to detect anomalies in the operation of equipment, often preceding failures.

## pycodehash: boost your pipeline by skipping all unchanged steps!

*Simon Brugman, Ralph*, *Data Science and Visualisation*

**Abstract:** Data pipelines are of paramount importance in data science, engineering and analysis. Often, there are parts of the pipeline that have not changed. Recomputing these nodes is wasteful, especially for larger datasets. PyCodeHash is a novel generic data and Python code hashing library that facilitates downstream caching.

## SpatialData: a FAIR framework for multimodal spatial omics

*Wouter-Michiel Vierdag, Luca Marconato*, *High Performance Computing*

**Abstract:** Spatial omics data generation displaying DNA, RNA and protein within their spatial context has been tremendously increasing in the last couple years. This has led to challenges for bioinformaticians tasked with analysing the data due to among others data size and a plethora of different formats being used by different researchers. Hence the need for highly performant findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) representation of this bioimaging data.
For this we developed the SpatialData framework, a solution that combines an on-disk format, the SpatialData format, with a set of Python libraries for accessing and operating on spatial omics data, and tools for interactive data annotation and visualization.The SpatialData library seamlessly integrates with the existing Python ecosystem by building upon standard scientific Python data types, such as xarray, dask, geopandas and anndata. Thereby providing a flexible, community standards-based, open framework to store, process, and annotate data from virtually any spatial omics technology available to date. With the simplified and interoperable data representation, the ability to easily create unified coordinate systems, and the numerous downstream analysis capabilities, it can facilitate the development, reproducibility and reuse of analysis pipelines, and ultimately unlock new approaches to unfold scientific questions.

## Streamlining Strain-Stress Analysis with Pydidas for XRD experiments

*Gudrun Lotze*, *Scientific Applications*

**Abstract:** X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals atomic structures in a variety of materials, from chocolate and biomaterials, like bone, toâ€¯hard coatings for CNC machining tools. Synchrotron radiation facilities constantly strive to engage new scientific communities. However, attracting new user groups can be challenging, as many are not familiar with XRD. Pydidas bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive framework for XRD analysis, featuring data processing, analysis, and visualization tools. It efficiently handles complex HDF5 files and provides near real-time feedback.â€¯ 
We introduce a new Pydidas workflow for X-ray diffraction-based strain-stress analysis, combining crystallographic data with mechanical properties. This integration aids in optimizing the material design by understanding how the microstructure influences macroscopic behaviour, advancing materials development in mechanical and aerospace engineering.

## From Logs to Insights: An Exploration of Infrastructure Logging and Clustering

*Arkadiusz TrawiÅ„ski*, *Data Science and Visualisation*

**Abstract:** The analysis of logging messages is a big challenge because of their massive number, different origins and unspecify formats. These challenges can be partially address with NLP techniques and ultimately detect, predict or even maybe avoid incidents. What we demonstrate is complete monitoring solution. That includes clustering and uncovering warning-incident correlation with a Hawkes model. This model was previously successfully applied for earthquake predictions based on aftershocks. The Hawkes process model is well-defined mathematically and can process a large volume of data.
