BXNEY8,The joys and pains of reproducing research: An experiment in bioimaging data analysis,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),Data Science and Visualisation,"The conversation about reproducibility is usually focused on how to make research workflows (more) reproducible. Here, we consider it from the opposite perspective, and ask: How feasible is it, in practice, to reproduce research which is meant to be reproducible? Is it even done or attempted? We provide a detailed account of such an attempt, trying to reproduce some segmentation results for 3D microscopy images of a developing mouse embryo. The original research is a monumental work of bioimaging and analysis at the single-cell level, published in *Cell* in 2018, alongside with all the necessary research artifacts. Did we succeed in this attempt? As we share the joys and pains of this journey, many questions arise: How do reviewers assess the reproducibility claims exactly? Incentivizing reproducible research is still an open problem, since it is so much more costly (in time) to produce. And how can we incentivize those who test reproducibility? Not only is it costly to set up computational environments and execute data-intensive scientific workflows, but it may not appear as rewarding at first thought. In addition, there is a human factor: It is thorny to show authors that their publication does not hold up to their reproducibility claims.",Marianne Corvellec

MFF7GE,Skrub: prepping tables for machine learning,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),Machine and Deep Learning,"When it comes to designing machine learning predictive models, it is reported that data scientists spend over 80% of their time preparing the data to input to the machine learning algorithm.

Currently, no automated solution exists to address this problem. However, the `skrub` Python library is here to alleviate some of the daily tasks of data scientists and offer an integration with the `scikit-learn` machine learning library.

In this talk, we provide an overview of the features available in `skrub`.

First, we focus on the preprocessing stage closest to the data sources. While predictive models usually expect a single design matrix and a target vector (or matrix), in practice, it is common that data are available from different data tables. It is also possible that the data to be merged are slightly different, making it difficult to join them. We will present the `skrub` joiners that handle such use cases and are fully compatible with `scikit-learn` and its pipeline.

Then, another issue widely tackled by data scientists is dealing with heterogeneous data types (e.g., dates, categorical, numerical). We will present the `TableVectorizer`, a preprocessor that automatically handles different types of encoding and transformation, reducing the amount of boilerplate code to write when designing predictive models with `scikit-learn`. Like the joiner, this transformer is fully compatible with `scikit-learn`.",Guillaume Lemaitre

NGECXK,Optimagic: Can we unify Python's numerical optimization ecosystem?,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),"Community, Education, and Outreach","Python has many high quality optimization algorithms but they are scattered across many different packages. Switching between packages is cumbersome and time consuming. Other languages are ahead of Python in this respect. For example, `Optimization.jl` provides a unified interface to more than 100 optimization algorithms and is widely accepted as a standard interface for optimization in Julia. 

In this talk, we take stock of the existing optimization ecosystem in Python and analyze pain points and reasons why no single package has emerged as a standard so far. We use these findings to derive desirable features a Python optimization package would need to unify the ecosystem. 

We then present optimagic, a NumFocus affiliated Project with the goal of unifying the Python optimization ecosystem. Optimagic provides a common interface to optimization algorithms from scipy, NlOpt, pygmo, and many other libraries. The minimize function feels familiar to users of scipy.optimize who are looking for a more extensive set of 
supported optimizers. Advanced users can use optional arguments to configure every aspect of the optimization, create a persistent log file, turn local optimizers global with a multistart framework, and more.

NetworkX is a popular, pure Python library used for graph(aka network) analysis. But when the graph size increases (like a network of everyone in the world), then NetworkX algorithms could take days to solve a simple graph analysis problem. So, to address these performance issues this backend dispatching mechanism was recently developed. In this talk, we will unveil this dispatching mechanism and its implementation details, and how we can use it just by specifying a `backend` kwarg like this:

    >>> nx.betweenness_centrality(G, backend=“parallel”)

or by passing the backend graph object(type-based dispatching):

    >>> H = nxp.ParallelGraph(G)
    >>> nx.betweenness_centrality(H)

We'll also go over the limitations of this dispatch mechanism. Then we’ll use the example of nx-parallel as a guide to building our own custom NetworkX backend. And then, using NetworkX's existing test suite, we'll test this backend that we build. Ending with a quick dive into the details of the nx-parallel backend.","Erik Welch, Aditi Juneja"
QMV8P3,"OpenGL is dying, let's talk about WebGPU",Maintainer track,Data Science and Visualisation,"OpenGL is old and on a path to being deprecated. Modern GPU API's like Vulkan and Metal solve most problems that plague OpenGL, and higher abstractions like wgpu / WebGPU provide a modern interface to control GPU hardware. The way that these work is much more pleasant to work with, and also provides performance benefits, especially for Python.",Almar Klein

SPUZPK,Enhancing Bayesian Optimization with Ensemble Models for Categorical Domains,Talk (15 mins + Q&A),Data Science and Visualisation,"Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing black-box, costly-to-evaluate functions, widely applicable across diverse fields. However, Gaussian process (GP) models commonly used in Bayesian optimization struggle with functions defined on categorical or mixed domains, limiting optimization in scenarios with numerous categorical inputs. In this talk, we present a solution by leveraging ensemble models for probabilistic modelling, providing a robust approach to optimize functions with categorical inputs. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through a Bayesian optimization setup implemented with the BoTorch library, utilizing probabilistic models from the XGBoostLSS framework. By integrating these tools, we achieve efficient optimization on domains with categorical variables, unlocking new possibilities for optimization in practical applications.",Ilya Komarov

U3EMKF,Regularizing Python using Structured Control Flow,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),High Performance Computing,"In this talk we will present applied research and working code to regularize
Python programs using a Structured Control Flow Graph (SCFG). This is a novel
approach to rewriting programs at the source level such that the resulting
(regularized) program is potentially more amenable to compiler optimizations,
for example when using Numba[1] to compile Python.  The SCFG representation of
a program is simpler to analyze and thus significantly easier to optimize
because the higher order semantic information regarding the program structure
is explicitly included. This can be of great benefit to many scientific
applications such as High Performance Computing (HPC), a discipline that relies
heavily on compiler optimizations to turn user source code into highly
performant executables. Additionally the SCFG format is a first step to
representing Python programs as Regionalized Value State Dependence Graphs
(RVSDGs). This is another recently proposed program representation which is
expected to unlock even more advanced compiler optimizations at the
Intermediary Representation (IR) level. The talk will cover an introduction to
the theory of SCFGs and RVSDG and demonstrate how programs are transformed. We
will start with simple Python programs containing control-flow constructs and
then show both the SCFG representation and the resulting regularized result to
illustrate the transformations.",Valentin Haenel

UF7LM8,A Hitchhiker's Guide to Contributing to Open Source,Tutorial,"Community, Education, and Outreach","Open-source projects are essential for scientific programming. They provide many tools and resources that can be customized for different scientific needs. However, sometimes the existing tools in a package don't meet all the requirements of a project. This is when contributing to open-source packages becomes important. By contributing, you can implement new functionalities, improve the software and help keep the open-source community strong.

This workshop will make contributing to open-source projects easier to understand. It will guide participants from just using the software to actively contributing to it. The workshop will address technical challenges such as interacting with web-based hosting services (like GitHub and GitLab), branching, and opening pull requests. Additionally, it will cover how to contribute documentation and ensure the correctness of the code.","Sebastian Berg, Nikoleta E. Glynatsi"
UGJ3HQ,Mostly Harmless Fixed Effects Regression in Python with PyFixest,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),Data Science and Visualisation,"This session introduces PyFixest, an open source Python library inspired by the ""fixest"" R package. PyFixest implements fast routines for the estimation of regression models with high-dimensional fixed effects, including OLS, IV, and Poisson regression. The library also provides tools for robust inference, including heteroscedasticity-robust and cluster robust standard errors, as well as the wild cluster bootstrap and randomization inference. Additionally, PyFixest implements several routines for difference-in-differences estimation with staggered treatment adoption.

PyFixest aims to faithfully replicate the core design principles of ""fixest"", offering post-estimation inference adjustments, user-friendly syntax for multiple estimations, and efficient post-processing capabilities. By making efficient use of jit-compilation, it is also one of the fastest solutions for regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects.

The presentation will argue why there is a need for another regression package in Python, cover PyFixest's functionality and design philosophy, and discuss future development prospects.",Alexander Fischer
UNYV7V,Probabilistic classification and cost-sensitive learning with scikit-learn,Tutorial,Machine and Deep Learning,"Data scientists are repeatedly told that it is absolutely critical to align their model training methodology with a specific business objective. While being a rather good advice, it usually falls short on details on how to achieve this in practice.

This hands-on tutorial aims to introduce helpful theoretical concepts and concrete software tools to help them bridge this gap. This method will be illustrated on a worked practical use case: optimizing the operations of a fraud detection system for a payment processing platform.

More specifically, we will introduce the concepts of calibrated probabilistic classifiers, how to evaluate them and fix common causes of mis-calibration. In a second part, we will explore how to turn probabilistic classifiers into optimal business decision makers.","Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Grisel"

XBXX89,forecasting foundation models: evaluation and integration with sktime – challenges and outcomes,Talk (25 mins + Q&A),Machine and Deep Learning,"Foundation models are here for forecasting! This will conclusively solve all forecasting problems with a one-model-fits-all approach! Or … maybe not?

Fact is, an increasingly growing number of foundation models for time series and forecasting hitting the market.

To innocent end users, this situation raises various challenges and questions. How do I integrate the models as candidates into existing forecasting workflows? Are the models performant? How do they compare to more classical choices? Which one to pick? How to know whether to “upgrade”?

At sktime, we have tried so you don’t have to! Although you will probably be forced to anyway, but even then, it’s worth sharing experiences.

Our key challenges and findings are presented in this talk – for instance, the unexpected fragmentation of the ecosystem, difficulties in evaluating the models fairly, and more.
