# Child Care Services

We are pleased to announce that this year again we will be offering free childcare
service. We collaborate with an experienced and professional 
[kindergarten](https://najlepszeszczecin.pl/) that will take care of your little ones while you enjoy the conference.

The childcare center is located close to the venue and children of preschool age
and babies older than two months can be accommodated there.

### Registration

In order to organize this service, we need to get an accurate estimate of the
number of children by **August 16**. We therefore require you to get a free
ticket for this service. It is available at the [registration
page](https://euroscipy.org/2024/tickets.html).

Be aware that ticket booking allows us to plan the number of slots to be
reserved. In case of a no-show or a cancellation after August 16, we will charge 
you with the full cost of the booked service.

### Organization

Parents can drop off and fetch their kids between 8.00 am and 5:30 pm.

**Note:** Parents of children younger than one year old should leave a telephone number at 
the childcare services and must be reachable by phone at all times.

The childcare service is located at
