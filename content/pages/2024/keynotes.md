### Abstract:

A lot has been happening in the field of AI and Natural Language Processing: 
there's endless excitement about new technologies, sobering post-hype hangovers 
and also uncertainty about where the field is heading next. In this talk, I'll 
share the most important lessons we've learned in 10 years of working on open 
source software, our core philosophies that helped us adapt to an ever-changing 
AI landscape and why open source and interoperability still wins over black-box,
proprietary APIs.
