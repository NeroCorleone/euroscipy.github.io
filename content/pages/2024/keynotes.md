# Keynotes

We are pleased to announce the following keynotes at EuroSciPy this year.

## 10 Years of Open Source: Navigating the Next AI Revolution {#keynote-1}

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="../../static/2024/ines_montani.jpeg"/> <br/> <i>Ines Montani - Explosion</i> </div>



### Abstract:

A lot has been happening in the field of AI and Natural Language Processing: 
there's endless excitement about new technologies, sobering post-hype hangovers 
and also uncertainty about where the field is heading next. In this talk, I'll 
share the most important lessons we've learned in 10 years of working on open 
source software, our core philosophies that helped us adapt to an ever-changing 
AI landscape and why open source and interoperability still wins over black-box,
proprietary APIs.

### Bio:

Ines Montani is a developer specializing in tools for AI and NLP technology. 
Sheâ€™s the co-founder and CEO of Explosion and a core developer of spaCy, a 
popular open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python, and 
Prodigy, a modern annotation tool for creating training data for machine 
learning models. Read more on [her website](https://ines.io/).

## Just contribute?! {#keynote-2}

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="../../static/2024/photo_wolf_V2aSSVN.jpg"/> <br/> <i>Wolf Vollprecht - prefix.dev </i> </div>



### Abstract:

Open source software is here for everyone - but how are we making sure that
everyone has equal access?
In this keynote I will discuss how to lower barriers of entry for new
contributors - and the many facets to this: documentation, community,
guidelines, and tools.
I will share my personal motivations on contributing to open source
software and my journey in the past 5 years with all of its learnings.

### Bio:

Wolf Vollprecht has been in open source for his entire professional career. He is a core 
member of conda-forge for the past 4 years. He started the `mamba` package 
manager (a C++ reimplementation of `conda`). He is also a steering council 
member for the `conda` project. He founded [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/) to 
take software package 
management to the next level. At prefix, `pixi` and `rattler-build` are 
developed to make shipping software a breeze.
