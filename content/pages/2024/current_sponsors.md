        Conducting research for a changing society:
        This is what drives us at Forschungszentrum Jülich.
         As a member of the Helmholtz Association, we aim to tackle the grand
         challenges of our times.
         How can we utilize the potential of artificial intelligence for
         society and science?
         How can we decode the human brain? How can we make a success of the
         energy transition and mitigate the effects of climate change?
         And how can we facilitate the transition to a sustainable economy in
         regions affected by structural change?
         Come and work with us at our scientific institutes, administration,
         or in research management alongside more than 7,400 colleagues from
         almost 80 countries at one of Europe’s biggest research centres and
         help make a contribution to solving societal challenges.
