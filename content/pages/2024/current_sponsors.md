            The mission of the
             <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Software Foundation</a>
            is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language,
            and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international
            community of Python programmers.
            The majority of the PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting
            people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs
            that support sprints, conferences, meet ups, user groups, and Python
            development efforts all over the world.
            In addition, the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US,
            the primary Python community conference.
            Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community.
            Recently we changed the PSF to an open membership organization,
            so that everyone who uses and supports Python can join.
