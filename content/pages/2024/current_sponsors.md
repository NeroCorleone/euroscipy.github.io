            We believe that data science and machine learning are enablers of
            our modern society.
            Data rich processes are better informed, more efficient and
            ultimately lead to better decisions. This is increasingly true as
            we face new challenges in our society, across and between nations,
            but also as a species.
            Probabl was created with a purpose.
            Its mission is to develop, maintain at the state of art, sustain,
            and disseminate a complete suite of open source tools for data
            science.
            Our commercial activities will unfold to support the long term
            mission.
