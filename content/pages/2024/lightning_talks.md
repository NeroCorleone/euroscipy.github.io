# Lightning Talks

Lightning talks are designed to be short five minutes long presentations about 
any topic that you wish to talk about: showing a demo of your code,
introducing your new project, introducing a cool package or feature, announcements for conferences and meetups, etc.

This year, we collect the topics for lightning talks through an online form and will do a raffle to choose topics. 

If you have a topic you would like to shortly talk about, please submit it [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemMPjtH8kHRCKaStEVecDgxe3dWD9K2iJSREkhDkethCAEHQ/viewform).
