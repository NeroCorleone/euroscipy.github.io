### Presenting at the Conference

##### Talk-Length
The allotted time for each talk includes a recommended 5 to 10 minute Q&A session. Please ensure your presentation fits within this timeframe and avoid exceeding your designated talk duration.

##### Session Chair
There will always be a session chair to announce you and moderate Q&A.   
The chair will also assist you if you require help, e.g. in case there are technical difficulties.

##### Q&A
The session chair will manage the questions received from the audience. 

#### Tech Set-Up

##### Tech-Check
Please check your equipment in the room where you will present earlier to make sure everything is compatible.
Please **show up 10 minutes before** your presentation to check your equipment.

##### Laptops
Please bring your own laptop to present.

##### Presentations / Projectors
All projectors support 16:9 full HD. Please make sure to bring an HDMI adapter for your laptop with you.

##### Recording
All talks and tutorials are recorded and released later on our YouTube channels. 

We would like to ask you to remain standing at the speaker desk and not move around too much. This is important for the recoding.  
If you want to highlight something on the slides, please consider using a laser pointer.

##### After Your Presentation
We need to make room for the next speaker, please clear the room for the breaks (so the technicians can have a break, too).
Please do leave the speaker desk directly. Continue any discussions with the audience not at the speaker desk but **outside the room**.

#### Language
The conference language is English only.  
We encourage everyone to use a gender-neutral language,   
here are some [guidelines](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/).  

There are some good examples in the [EU guidelines](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/151780/GNL_Guidelines_EN.pdf), starting at page 10.

In case you need help, contact program[at]euroscipy.org.
