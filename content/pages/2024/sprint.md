# Sprint

A one-day sprint is organized on August 30. Open source sprints are session
where maintainers and contributors (including first time contributors) meet,
and work together in improving the open source projects. This can include bug
fixes, new features, improvements to the documentation and others.

Sprints are a great way to get started in open source development, learn, and
meet like-minded people. All EuroSciPy attendees are welcome and encouraged
to join the sprint.

The definitive schedule is not yet known and more project sprints will be added when
they are proposed, and some will be improvised in the same day. If you want
to propose a sprint, please send us a message to
<a href="mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org">maintainers@euroscipy.org</a> .
