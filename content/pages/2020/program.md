# The conference has been cancelled this year!

As you probably already know, locked down in your homes, the Coronavirus is spreading throughout Europe and we wanted to give you an update on our decision around the situation.

To help not spread the virus, and also avoid big organizational troubles with the instability of the national borders and flight schedules, we have been evaluating online tools to create webinars. However, we donâ€™t believe they can provide a really good conference experience. It would require all speakers to have a good internet connection, media, and lighting. Also the format of the programme of the conference would have to change considerably.

Going straight to the point, **we have decided to skip EuroSciPy 2020**.

EuroSciPy 2021 will happen for sure, probably at the traditional time near August, however, the location and the plan are still being discussed. We will announce our decision next month.

To the people who already bought their tickets, we will make the refund within the next week, please note that it may take up to 4 weeks to receive your money once the refund is done. If you do not receive a refund, please reach out to one of the organising committee, and we will do our best to rectify it.

We are really sad about this situation but we think this is the best we can do to avoid making things worse.

Stay safe, hasta pronto and remember social distancing and to wash your hands for 20 seconds.
