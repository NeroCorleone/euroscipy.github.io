# Keynotes

We are pleased to announce the following keynotes at EuroSciPy this year.

##JAX and Flax: Function Transformations and Neural Networks {#jax-and-flex}

*Andreas Steiner - Google*

**Bio:**

After his original studies in medicine, an MSc in bio-electronics, and MD with 
the Swiss Tropical Health Institute, Andreas has been working at Google since 2015. 
His main focus there has been on machine learning using Tensorflow and data 
mining, development of internal tools for data analysis.

**Abstract:**

Modern accelerators (graphics processing units and tensor processing units)
allow for high performance computing at massive scale. JAX traces computation
in Python programs through the familiar numpy API, and uses XLA to compile
programs that run efficiently on these accelerators. A set of composable
function transformations allows for expressing versatile scientific computing
with an elegant syntax.

Flax provides abstractions on top of JAX that make it easy to handle weights
and other states that is required for solving problems using neural networks.

This talk first presents the basic JAX API that allows for computing gradients,
compiling functions, or vectorizing computation. It then proceeds to cover
other parts of the JAX ecosystem commonly used for neural network programming,
such as basic building blocks and optimizers.

## Supercharging Open Data with Open Privacy {#privacy-enhancing}

*Katharine Jarmul - Thoughtworks*

**Bio:**

Katharine Jarmul is a Principal Data Scientist at Thoughtworks Germany focusing 
on privacy, ethics and security for data science workflows. Previously, she has 
held numerous roles at large companies and startups in the US and Germany, 
implementing data processing and machine learning systems with a focus on 
reliability, testability, privacy and security.
She is a passionate and internationally recognized data scientist, programmer, and lecturer.

**Abstract:**

Privacy is becoming an increasingly pressing topic in data collection and data science. 
Thankfully, Privacy Enhancing Technologies (or PETs) are maturing alongside the 
growing demand and concern. In this keynote, we'll explore what possibilities 
emerge when using Privacy Enhancing Technology like differential privacy, 
encrypted computation and federated learning and investigate how these 
technologies could change the face of data science today.
