## This was EuroSciPy 2022 in Basel

### A Successful Conference

EuroSciPy 2022 was a great success.
After a two-year break, it resumed its yearly schedule.
Even though the decision to have an in-person event could be made only very
late, leading to very tight deadlines,
the conference was well-attended.
Many high-quality talks and tutorials by members of the European scientific
Python community made up the core of this event.

### EuroSciPy 2022 in Numbers

We counted *210 attendees* including people joining via 17 streaming access.
*Three exciting keynotes* started the conference days.
Beginners and advanced users learned in new topics in *16 tutorials*.
The latest research topics were presented in *30 talks*.

### Poster Session

Talk slots are limited.
But EuroSciPy 2022 offered a poster session.
The poster session gave presenters the opportunity to explain their projects
and software packages.
Very lively discussions provided a great opportunity to learn more about
cutting-edge Python projects.

### Sprints

The last conference days was dedicated to sprints.
These projects gatherer core developers and newbies in sprints:

* Bokeh
* NetworkX
* Pandas - GeoPandas
* Scikit-learn
* The Mission Support System

Sprints are a great opportunity for developer teams that work remotely for most
of the time to meet in person.
There are also good way to onboard new team members.

### Sponsors

EuroSciPy is a volunteer-run conference.
Financially, the conference targets a balanced budget without profits.
Ticket prices are kept as low as possible, especially for participants who
otherwise wouldn't be able to join.
Furthermore, the conference offers financial aid waiving ticket fees and
providing travel grants.

To achieve this, contributions of sponsors are essentiell.
The following company and institutions supported EuroSciPy 2022.
