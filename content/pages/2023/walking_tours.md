# Walking Tours of the Historical City Center

The best way to explore Basel's Old Town is on foot, as the many places of interest 
are close to one another. The walking tours allow you to discover 
the hidden nooks and crannies of the Old Town and its history. 

We're happy to announce that this year, we have organized guided walking tours of 
the historical city center of Basel for the attendees. The tours will be in English.

Following two tours are schedules for EuroSciPy2023 attendees:
1. On 15.08 from 18:00 to 19:30 
2. On 17.08 from 18:00 to 19:30
